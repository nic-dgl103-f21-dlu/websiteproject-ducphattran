              <b>Outback Nursery</b> is one of the largest garden centres on Vancouver Island. Our
              nursery is situated on a 6 acre property and offers 5 overflowing greenhouses
              (30x170ft); almost 23,000 square feet. Outback Nursery began in 1998-1999 when our
              parents retired to the island from Aldergrove. They asked if we'd be interested in
              joining them and then purchased this heavily treed property. We began clearing some
              trees and settled into country life trying our hand at raising some turkeys and pigs
              as well as growing some hedging and conifers. We joined the Farmer's Market, then as
              our inventory expanded we began running a spec truck down island stopping here and
              there to show our quality product to potential customers. Little by little the
              property was cleared and one by one the greenhouses and irrigation zones increased to
              what you see today. In the beginning we were limited to wholesale and landscape
              clientele, then somewhere along the way interest in our nursery grew and we opened to
              the public.

            <p>
              Planting or gardening depends on the season and weather.
              <b>Outback Nursery</b> usually closes for the Winter break and reopens in March. Our
              product varies from different seasons, you can pre-order the product on our website.
              Whenever season changes, we need some time to clear off the old trees on the land and
              plant new seeds. Thus, the service is closed due to these days. However, if you need
              some advices or instructions for gardening, please do not hesitate to call us. The
              best way to keep up with us is to follow us on
